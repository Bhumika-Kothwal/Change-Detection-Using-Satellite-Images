<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![input]()  
![Final output]()  

The aim of the project is to detect the changes in the forest cover of a speciffic area from the satellite images which are already denoised and registered. The process involves the concept of PCA for analyzing the principal components of the image in order to form a vector set which can be further clustered into smaller and significant groups. Clusteing involves the K-means clustering algorithm which is further used to detect the change. 
Refer this [documentation]().
